# GTPL - Golang Templates
`GTPL` is a simplified templating system that makes separation of HTML and application logic easy. This small library was created as the successor of `vision` (https://github.com/protosam/vision/). `GTPL` takes HTML that is sliced into blocks with html comments, parses out blocks as needed, and can even run registered functions.

## The Example
If you switch to the the `example` directory you will find a basic example of how to use `GTPL`. Running it is as simple as `go run runme.go`!
